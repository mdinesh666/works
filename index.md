I design and deliver robust B2B enterprise applications by partnering closely with product management and software architects. From initial requirements to final release, I maintain rigorous accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) while managing comprehensive design systems. I leverage AI tools and prompt engineering to accelerate application building and ensure precise design-to-dev handoffs via MCP protocols.
