**Designing a distraction-free navigation tool for Swiggy and Zomato delivery partners.**

## The Problem
Delivery partners often struggle with phone batteries dying and distractions from other apps while navigating. The goal was to build a dedicated hardware device.

## The Process
I started by selecting the **ESP32 WROOM** development board due to its low cost and Wi-Fi capabilities. For the display, I chose a 1.8 inch TFT screen.

## The Solution
The final prototype connects to the user's phone via Bluetooth to fetch turn-by-turn data but displays only arrows and distance, reducing cognitive load.
